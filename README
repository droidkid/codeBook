codeBook
----------

A small blogging platform mostly for educational use and personal purposes.
The goal is to organize frequently used code snippets in programming contests
as a series of blog posts.

To use it, clone the project and do
python run.py

This will run the app on port 5000(for now).

localhost:5000/ - view all posts.
localhost:5000/edit/<postCode> - create/edit post.
localhost:500/post/<postCode> - view post

TODO
-----
The App needs a lot of work. Right now the front end enables viewing all posts,
adding/editing new posts.
So what needs to be done?
- password protection
- delete posts/tags
- orgainze posts by tags
- search by tags, search for posts
- edit button on post page
- A better home page (the app is a work in progress if you can't tell by now)
- Pagination
- Date Field for posts
- Better (and more?) comments in code.

Built( or Building) Using
-------------
Flask - a lightweight python web framework.
SqLite - a simple (relatively) simple database
google Prettify - to make the code look better.

Resources Used
--------------
Font-Awesome
mormalize.css


Writing Posts
-----------------

Since this app was created for learning purposes, I decided to write my own markDown/asciiDoc engine.
The format is as follows

== h1 ==
=== h2 ===
==== h3 ====
===== h4 =====

The equal after h1 is optional.

[link 'text' href]


``````````````
code here
``````````````

*bold*
/italic/

.Optional Header

-list1
 -nested lists
-list2
-list3

\* - escape Sequence

The Parsing stuff is done in smdparser.py . It doesn't do any fancy stuff, just guesses the type of block
the markdown is starting with (` for code, - for list), then parses that block. This is repeated till the end
of the input.

Table Schema
------------
The Table Schema is in db/schema.sql
